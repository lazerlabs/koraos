# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
The bare-metal kernel lives under `src/`, mixing C (`kernel.c`, `gpio.c`, `memory_access.c`) with short assembly stubs (`boot.S`, `mm.S`, `utils.S`). Shared interfaces are in `include/` with peripheral-specific headers in `include/peripherals/`. Device tree blobs and boot assets sit in `firmware/`. Build helpers live in `cmake/` and scripts at the repository root; the `build/` directory is generated and may be safely removed between builds.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Run `./build.sh` to configure CMake, compile for the selected Raspberry Pi target, and refresh `build/compile_commands.json` for clangd. To inspect or tweak flags manually:

```bash
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. -DRPI_VERSION=4
cmake --build . -j$(nproc 2>/dev/null || sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
```

The legacy `make` command still works and respects the `RPI_VERSION` and `BOOTMNT` environment variables; use it when scripting with existing tooling. After every build, confirm `build/kernel8.img` and `build/kernel8.elf` exist.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Follow the existing clang-flavored C style: four-space indentation, braces on the same line as declarations, and `snake_case` for functions and variables (`gpio_pin_set_func`). Keep headers self-contained and prefer `const` pointers for register blocks defined in `include/`. Preprocessor constants remain uppercase (`RPI_VERSION`, `QEMU_TESTING`). When in doubt, mirror the patterns in `src/gpio.c` and `include/common.h`.

## Testing Guidelines
There is no automated test suite yet. Smoke-test changes by booting `build/kernel8.img` on the intended hardware or via your QEMU setup. Use `BOOTMNT=/Volumes/BOOT ./build.sh` (or `make`) to copy artifacts into a mounted SD card image. Include any UART logs or observed regressions in your PR.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Commits follow short, imperative subjects (`Use CMakefile instead of Makefile`). Group related changes and avoid work-in-progress checkpoints. PRs should explain the motivation, list user-visible effects, note the Raspberry Pi model exercised, and attach screenshots or UART output if behavior changes. Link issues when applicable and call out configuration defaults you touched.

## Hardware & Deployment Tips
Keep device tree blobs in `firmware/` synchronized with the Raspberry Pi revision you target. Long-lived branches should re-run `./build.sh` so clangd picks up new compilation flags. When changing memory maps or linker scripts, double-check `src/linker.ld` and document the update in your PR description.
