# KoraOS

KoraOS is a bare-metal Raspberry Pi kernel written in C with a small assembly shim. The project targets the aarch64 architecture, focuses on UART bring-up, and uses LLVM/Clang together with CMake for a modern cross-compilation workflow.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build QEMU and hardware variants (creates build/compile_commands.json)
./build.sh

# Boot the QEMU image
./run-qemu.sh
```

You need LLVM/Clang, CMake 3.20+, and (optionally) QEMU installed on your workstation. The build script produces `build/kernel8.img` for virtualization and `build/kernel8-hw.img` when the hardware variant is enabled. Re-run `./build.sh` whenever you change compiler flags so clangd receives updated metadata via `build/compile_commands.json`.

## Building for Hardware

```bash
BOOTMNT=/Volumes/BOOT ./build.sh --hw --release
cmake --build build --target install_hw
```

This generates a Mini-UART-aware image and copies it, along with `config.txt`, to your mounted SD card partition (`BOOTMNT`). Safely eject the volume before inserting it into the Raspberry Pi.

## Documentation

- `docs/developer-guide.md` – Toolchain requirements, build configurations, QEMU workflow, and Raspberry Pi deployment instructions.

Keep documentation in `docs/` current as the project evolves. Avoid placing temporary notes or todo lists there; use issue trackers or other channels for work-in-progress planning.
